# Profiling

The best tool to profile C++ is currently [`gperf-tools`](
https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools). It allows even to make line-by-line
profiling.

Check the [`README`](
https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools/blob/master/README) to know how to
compile and activate the memory and CPU profiling.
