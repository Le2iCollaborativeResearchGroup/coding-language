# Guide style for Python

### Guideline

You need to follow the [PEP8](
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) convention when you are coding.

### Automatic checking tools

To check the file and get a report, use [`flake8`](
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8).

```
pip install flake8
```

To correct automatically most of the PEP8 error, you can use the package
[`yapf`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yapf/0.16.0):

```
pip install yapf
```
